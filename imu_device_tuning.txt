The IMU device currently used is 9DoF Razor IMU

Please read the doc, imu_fields.pdf for configuration instruction with a serial terminal program like cutecom.


Desired configuration of 9DoF for the program igsrv to work:

 Imu is set to output accelerometers (x,y,z) - full-scale range +-16g
 Imu is set to output gyro (x,y,x) - full-scale range +-2000 dps

 Imu is set to output 8 feilds:
 timestatmp, accelX, accelY, accelZ gyroX, gyroY, gyroZ, unknown

 IMU output frequency is set to 50Hz, ie interval of 20ms.

 Currently, the  IMU read frequency in the igsrv is set to 19ms.


Brief instruction of

1. the default baud rate set to connect to 9DoF is 11520
If cannot read, change to 9600 to check out.

2. cutecom and connect to /dev/imu_9DoF

3. toggle " " (space bar) to pause output ( same command to resume later)

4. toggle "r" (multiple times and see the output) to change rate to 50Hz

5. toggle "A" to set the  accelerometer full-scale range to +-16g

6. toggle "G" to set the gyroscope full-scale range to +-2000 dps

7. toglle " " to resume output of data

8. toggle "a" to ensure accelerometer is output

9. toggle "g" to ensure gyroscope is output

10. toggle "c" to ensure calculated instead of raw gyroscope output

11. toggle "m" to ensure magnetometer is NOT output
